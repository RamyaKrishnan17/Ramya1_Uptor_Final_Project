Project Title:

    ""Student Performance Prediction""

Objective:

    The objective of this project is to analyze student performance based on certain features and
    predict whether a student will pass or fail using a supervised learning algorithm (Random Forest).
    Additionally, we apply an unsupervised learning algorithm (K-Means Clustering) to group students
    based on their study behaviors.

Dataset:

    The dataset is assumed to be a CSV file named student_exam_data.csv that contains the
    following features:

    Column Name	Description:

        Study Hours	--> Number of hours a student studies per week.
        Previous Exam Score -->	Previous exam scores of the student.
        Pass/Fail -->	The target variable indicating whether a student passed (1) or failed (0).

Example dataset:

Study Hours		Previous Exam Score	    Pass/Fail
    5		            70	              0
    12		            85	              1
    15		            95	              1
    3		            60	              0
    7		            75	              0
    10		            80	              1
    18		            90	              1
    6		            65	              0
    8		            80	              0
    20		            92	              1

Approach:

    1. Supervised Learning (Random Forest Classifier):

            We will use Random Forest, a powerful ensemble classification algorithm, to predict whether
            a student will pass or fail based on their Study Hours and Previous Exam Score.
            This model is suitable for classification tasks and will allow us to understand how these
            features correlate with the pass/fail outcome.

    2. Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering):

            We will use K-Means Clustering to group students into clusters based on their study behaviors
            (such as Study Hours and Previous Exam Scores). The idea is to segment
            students into similar groups to identify patterns or trends in their learning behavior.

Implementation Steps:

        Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration

            Load the CSV File: Use pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
            Data Inspection: Check the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure, and
            inspect for missing or erroneous data.

        Step 2: Data Preprocessing

            Handle Missing Data: In real-world scenarios, datasets might have missing values. We need to
            handle these (e.g., by filling or removing missing values).
            Feature Selection: Select the relevant columns (Study Hours, Previous Exam Scores) as features
            for both supervised and unsupervised learning.
            Feature Scaling: For K-Means, features should be standardized to prevent one feature from
            dominating the others in terms of scale.

        Step 3: Supervised Learning - Random Forest Classifier

            Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets
            (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
            Model Training: Use the training set to train the Random Forest Classifier.
            Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using accuracy or other performance metrics like
            precision, recall, and F1-score.

        Step 4: Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering
            Standardization: Before applying K-Means, scale the data using StandardScaler to ensure that
            all features are on a similar scale.
            Clustering: Apply K-Means Clustering to group students into clusters.
            Visualization: Visualize the clusters using a scatter plot to understand how students are
            grouped based on their study behaviors.

Explanation of Code:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        pd.read_csv('student_data.csv') loads the dataset.
        We split the dataset into features (Study Hours, Previous_Exam_Score) and the
        target variable (Pass/Fail).

    Supervised Learning (Random Forest Classifier):

        We split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
        We train the Random Forest model using RandomForestClassifier and evaluate the model using
        accuracy_score().

    Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering):

        We scale the features using StandardScaler to standardize the data.
        We apply K-Means clustering to group students into clusters. In this case, we assume
        two clusters (n_clusters=2).
        We visualize the clusters using a scatter plot, coloring the data points according to their
        cluster label.

Expected Results:

    Random Forest Classifier: The accuracy of the Random Forest model is expected to be high (e.g., > 90%),
    which indicates that the model can predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their
    study-related features.

    K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm will group students into two clusters. These clusters
    represent groups of students with similar study behaviors. The scatter plot will help visualize how
    the clusters are formed based on Study Hours and Previous Exam Score.


Conclusion:

    This project demonstrates how to apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to
    predict student performance and group students based on their study behaviors. By using
    Random Forest for classification and K-Means for clustering, this project provides insights into
    student performance while also segmenting students for targeted interventions.
